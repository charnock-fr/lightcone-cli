"""Building the policy a sandboxed command runs under.

One policy, both mechanisms. This module decides *what* a command may
touch; :mod:`~lightcone.engine.sandbox.landlock` and
:mod:`~lightcone.engine.sandbox.seatbelt` only decide how to say it.

The shape it encodes is what a container gives the command, minus the
container: the project and the declared inputs and the OS baseline
readable, the in-tree write scope (a recipe's own output directory; a
probe's ``results/``) and a private scratch scope writable, and only
the project's own environment plus a versioned utility allowlist
runnable. What it catches is a command reaching *outside* that set — a
tool, a library, or a data file that is on this machine and would not be
in the image.

A read-only tree with one writable directory inside it is the shape all
three mechanisms express *natively*, which is why it is the shape:
Landlock unions rights over ancestors, so a nested grant only ever
widens; SBPL restates the write tier after the guard; and podman mounts
the project ``:ro`` with ``results`` ``:rw`` over it. The reverse — a
writable tree with a read-only hole in it — needs rights *subtraction*,
which Landlock cannot do at all.

#: a terminal all do.
#:
#: Granting the whole devpts directory is deliberate. The threat model is
#: accidental leakage, not a hostile recipe, and terminals are
#: not a channel undeclared *inputs* arrive through. It is also less
#: permissive than it reads: Landlock only ever removes access, never adds
#: it, so ordinary Unix permissions still apply — devpts gives each pty to

#:
#: `/dev/zero` and `/dev/full` are here rather than in the read baseline
#: because writes to them are discard-by-construction — that is what the

#: `/dev/full` to exercise ENOSPC handling. Only the entropy sources stay
#: read-only, since writing to those seeds the host's pool.
#:
#: `/proc` and `/sys` are unrestricted for the same reason. Real tools do
#: write them — `/proc/self/oom_score_adj`, `coredump_filter`, MPI and
#: CUDA runtimes poking `/sys` — and none of that is a channel undeclared
